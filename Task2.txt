1)	List 5 difference between Browser JS(console) v Nodejs?

	Javascript is a programming language that is used for writing scripts on the website.	NodeJS is a Javascript runtime environment.
	Javascript can only be run in the browsers.	NodeJS code can be run outside the browser.
	It is basically used on the client-side.	It is mostly used on the server-side.
	Javascript is capable enough to add HTML and play with the DOM.	Nodejs does not have capability to add HTML tags.
	Javascript can run in any browser engine as like JS core in safari and Spidermonkey in Firefox.	Nodejs can only run in V8 engine of google chrome.

3)	To read - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5641997/is-it-necessary-to-write-head-body-and-html-tags?
 do we html tags? 
 It's true that the HTML specs permit certain tags to be omitted in certain cases, but generally doing so is unwise.

It has two effects - it makes the spec more complex, which in turn makes it harder for browser authors to write correct implementations (as demonstrated by IE getting it wrong).

This makes the likelihood of browser errors in these parts of the spec high. As a website author you can avoid the issue by including these tags - so while the spec doesn't say you have to, doing so reduces the chance of things going wrong, which is good  practice.

4) Execute the bellow code and write your description in txt file

f)typeof(undefined)-undefiend
g) typeof([])- Object
h)type({})-object
i)typeof(Nan)- Number

5)Read what is prototype?

A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept or process. It is a term used in a variety of contexts, including semantics, design, electronics, and software programming. A prototype is generally used to evaluate a new design to enhance precision by system analysts and users.
